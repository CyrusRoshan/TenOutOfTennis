data collection: accelerometer x y z
can compare to each other
need to model in positional (unless find another)


app:
	if we log in, we log in with facebook

analysis:
- dynamic time warping to match similar parts (if there are similar parts)
- compare how similar they are (may just have to preset threshold, with no ml)
- if good, if bad

- figure out how to aggregate data
- figure out how to compare data

- more info: can do like a pie chart of how many of their stroke have been which one, which one over time
